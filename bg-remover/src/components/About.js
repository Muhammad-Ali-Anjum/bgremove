      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>I am a dedicated Full Stack Web Developer with expertise in both front-end and back-end development. With strong skills in custom WordPress websites, PHP, frontend development, WooCommerce, and API integrations, I approach every project with a combination of technical proficiency and creativity. I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science, constantly expanding my knowledge and applying new technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python.

In addition to web development, I am passionate about building AI solutions, including a project focused on eye disease detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I am also working on a restaurant management system that combines WordPress, React.js, and Node.js to streamline operations.

Collaborative and always eager to grow professionally, I am seeking a full-time position to apply my full-stack skills and contribute to impactful projects.
